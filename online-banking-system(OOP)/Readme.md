## Object-Oriented Programming Tutorial

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in software engineering that allows software engineers to structure code in a more organized and modular way.

## Key Concepts of OOP

### Classes

Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.

### Objects

Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and encapsulate data and behavior.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and supports hierarchical relationships between classes.

### Constructor

A constructor ( **init**() ) is a special type of method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the newly created object, setting initial values for its attributes or performing any necessary setup tasks.

## Hints & Tips

- Classes are just templates, You need to create an object for your class to work.

Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm that allows software engineers to write code that is reusable, maintainable, and can scale.

Python's simplicity makes it an excellent choice for learning and implementing OOP concepts.
